This technique, while not limited to anesthesia, has seen wide application only in the perioperative setting where anesthesia related drugs are infused to obtain a stable sedation when total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is used.\n\nTCI is based on pharmacometric models called PKPD models for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. These models describe the drug distribution and metabolism through the body (pharmacokinetics) and the effect of the drug on the body (pharmacodynamics). Most of the time, the effect will be the level of sedation but this is not mandatory. From the first uses of TCI in the 1980s @struys_history_2016 to today, a lot of effort has gone into the development of new PKPD models. These models are now available for nearly every drug used for anesthesia. A lot of literature is available on PKPD models and model design and a lot of software is available to build and fit these models. The best known software is NONMEM but numerous others are available, even open source software such as nlmixr2 @nlmixr.\n\n\n\n## Why\nTarget controlled infusion (TCI) has pioneered in anesthesia and has seen commercial success, first with the development of the Diprifusor device and later with \"Open TCI\" devices.\nNew PKPD models are constantly developed in the field of anesthesia. There are also a lot of ressources available on how to develop PKPD models and there is open source software available to develop and fit these models @nlmixr.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the constants from the Gepts model for Sufentanil.\n\n::: {#5c12fee1 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Linearity of Pharmacokinetics and Model Estimation of Sufentanil by Gepts et al.\n# DOI: 10.1097/00000542-199512000-00010\n\nVc = 14.3    # L\nk10 = 0.0645 # min⁻¹\nk12 = 0.1086 # min⁻¹\nk13 = 0.0229 # min⁻¹\nk21 = 0.0245 # min⁻¹\nk31 = 0.0013 # min⁻¹\nke0 = 0.112  # min⁻¹\n```\n:::\n\n\nDifferential equations for the 3-compartment model PK system\n\n$\\frac{dA_1}{dt} = A_2 k_{21} + A_3 k_{31} - A_1(k_{10} + k_{12} + k_{13}) + \\text{Infusion}$\n\n$\\frac{dA_2}{dt} = A_1 k_{12} - A_2 k_{21}$\n\n$\\frac{dA_3}{dt} = A_1 k_{13} - A_3 k_{31}$\n\n$\\frac{dC_e}{dt} = k_{e0}\\left(\\frac{A_1}{V_c} - C_e\\right)$\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n",
