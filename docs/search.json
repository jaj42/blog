    "title": "Using the Nokia 6510 GSM modem over IrDA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "So it looks like everybody has a smartphone nowadays, however I still use my Nokia 6510 on a daily basis. Like many phones back then, it has an IrDA (Infrared Data Association) interface which permits communication with the phone and I felt like playing with it a bit. For this I used a laptop with integrated IrDA interface, the OpenBSD operating system and the ppp tool that ships with it, the birda package and the smstools package. The ircomm tool that ships with birda lets you initiate an IrDA COMM connection with the phone and lets you attach a pseudo terminal to it:\nircomm -d /dev/tty01 -y /dev/ptypz\nHere, /dev/tty01 is the actual IrDA interface that ircomm talks to and /dev/ptypz is a pseudo terminal it allocates that lets you talk to the GSM modem inside the device. The modem understands AT style commands. Actually you don’t talk directy to the modem but rather to some restricted modem emulation.\nFor more information see:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set#GSM\nhttp://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Hardware:AT_Commands\nhttp://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Manually_using_GSM\nhttp://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Manually_using_GPRS\n\nI use the ppp(8) tool to talk to the modem but anything else will work. Here’s a first session:\nspaceman% sudo ppp\nPassword:\nWorking in interactive mode\nUsing interface: tun0\nWarning: No default entry found in config file.\nppp ON spaceman&gt; set device /dev/ttypz\nppp ON spaceman&gt; term\ndeflink: Entering terminal mode on /dev/ttypz\nType `~?' for help\nATE1\nOK\n\nRING\n\nRING\nATA\nOK\nATH\nOK\nATD0952880000;\nOK\n\nNO CARRIER\nAT\nOK\n\nppp ON spaceman&gt;\nSome explanations: “ATE1” enables echoing, which enables you to see what you type, this is not required. The phone responds with “OK” when it correctly processes a command. I then call the phone and the modem shows that a call is incoming with the “RING” signal. You can then accept the call with “ATA” or reject it with “ATH”. I accepted the call, talked a bit and then hung up using “ATH”. Then I called my home phone from the mobile phone using the ATD command. ‘D’ here stands for dialling and the command dials the number that follows the command. I then hung up from the home phone which the modem signals with “NO CARRIER”.\nHere’s another session where I try to establish a GPRS connection for tethering. This unfortunately doesn’t work, I don’t really know why, probably the provider forbids it:\nppp ON spaceman&gt; term\nAT+CGDCONT=1,\"IP\",\"gprs-service-fr.net\"\nOK\nATD*99#\nCONNECT\nppp ON spaceman&gt; Warning: Sending empty PAP authname!\nPpp ON spaceman&gt;\nPPp ON spaceman&gt; Warning: ff01:8::: Change route failed: errno: Network is unreachable\nWarning: ff02:8::: Change route failed: errno: Network is unreachable\nWarning: ff02:8::: Change route failed: errno: Network is unreachable\nppp ON spaceman&gt;\nSo here I first set the APN which is needed for GPRS, using the CGDCONT command, the value depends on your provider. Then I dial the special number *99#. The modem tries to establish the connection, which it signals with “CONNECT”. It then starts talking PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol). The ppp(8) tool detects the fact that PPP is now spoken and takes over to establish a PPP link, which unfortunately fails here. The number of capital ’P’s on the prompt show the state of the connection:\nppp ON awfulhak&gt;               # No link has been established\nPpp ON awfulhak&gt;               # We've connected & finished LCP\nPPp ON awfulhak&gt;               # We've authenticated\nPPP ON awfulhak&gt;               # We've agreed IP numbers\nSo, as you can see here, authentication is successful but we don’t get an IP address. When it fails, the phone beeps and shows the following error: “Subscribe to GPRS first”.\nOne final thing I wanted to play with is SMS. Writing SMSes manually using AT style commands is cumbersome, so I used the smstools package which comes with a daemon that does the dirty work of talking to the modem. I set it up to talk to the /dev/ptypz device. Once it runs you can send SMSes using the “sendsms” command line tool, for example:\nspaceman% sendsms 33668360000 'Test Message'\nMy phone number actually starts in “0668”. “33” is the international prefix of my country (France), so you get how you have to format the number.\nHere is the log of the smsd daemon for this command:\n2011-02-07 17:06:58,5, smsd: Moved file /var/spool/sms/outgoing/send_qzxMhS to /var/spool/sms/checked\n2011-02-07 17:06:58,6, GSM1: I have to send 1 short message for /var/spool/sms/checked/send_qzxMhS\n2011-02-07 17:06:58,6, GSM1: Sending SMS from  to 33668360000\n2011-02-07 17:06:58,6, GSM1: Checking if modem is ready\n2011-02-07 17:06:59,7, GSM1: -&gt; AT\n2011-02-07 17:06:59,7, GSM1: Command is sent, waiting for the answer\n2011-02-07 17:06:59,7, GSM1: &lt;- OK\n2011-02-07 17:06:59,6, GSM1: Pre-initializing modem\n2011-02-07 17:06:59,7, GSM1: -&gt; ATE0+CMEE=1;+CREG=2\n2011-02-07 17:07:00,7, GSM1: Command is sent, waiting for the answer\n2011-02-07 17:07:00,7, GSM1: &lt;- OK\n2011-02-07 17:07:01,7, GSM1: -&gt; AT+CSQ\n2011-02-07 17:07:01,7, GSM1: Command is sent, waiting for the answer\n2011-02-07 17:07:01,7, GSM1: &lt;- +CSQ: 20,99 OK\n2011-02-07 17:07:01,6, GSM1: Signal Strength Indicator: (20,99) -73 dBm (Excellent), Bit Error Rate: not known or not detectable\n2011-02-07 17:07:01,6, GSM1: Checking if Modem is registered to the network\n2011-02-07 17:07:01,7, GSM1: -&gt; AT+CREG?\n2011-02-07 17:07:02,7, GSM1: Command is sent, waiting for the answer\n2011-02-07 17:07:02,7, GSM1: &lt;- +CREG: 2,1,\"00D6\",\"9C99\" OK\n2011-02-07 17:07:02,6, GSM1: Modem is registered to the network\n2011-02-07 17:07:02,6, GSM1: Selecting PDU mode\n2011-02-07 17:07:02,7, GSM1: -&gt; AT+CMGF=0\n2011-02-07 17:07:03,7, GSM1: Command is sent, waiting for the answer\n2011-02-07 17:07:03,7, GSM1: &lt;- OK\n2011-02-07 17:07:03,7, GSM1: -&gt; AT+CMGS=18\n2011-02-07 17:07:04,7, GSM1: Command is sent, waiting for the answer\n2011-02-07 17:07:04,7, GSM1: &lt;- &gt;\n2011-02-07 17:07:04,7, GSM1: -&gt; 0011000B913366388639F90000FF04F4F29C0E\n2011-02-07 17:07:06,7, GSM1: Command is sent, waiting for the answer\n2011-02-07 17:07:10,7, GSM1: &lt;- +CMGS: 214 OK\n2011-02-07 17:07:10,5, GSM1: SMS sent, Message_id: 214, To: 33668360000, sending time 12 sec.\n2011-02-07 17:07:10,6, GSM1: Deleted file /var/spool/sms/checked/send_qzxMhS\nThe message got delivered correctly. smsd is also able to receive incoming SMS, however I haven’t tried it and I’m not sure it works since the modem of this phone does not signal anything when it receives a message.\nThe birda package also includes some tools to use OBEX over IrDA. This lets you send and receive vCards with contacts (what Nokia calls “Business Cards”). For example, to send a vCard with a contact named “John” and phone number 06… to your phone you can use the following command:\nmkobextel -n John -t 0668360001 |  irobex -d /dev/tty01\nReceiving vCards sent from the phone also works.\nHave fun!\nUpdate: I just add this here for the nostalgia\nAT+CGMI\nNokia Mobile Phones\n\nOK\nAT+CGMM\nNokia 6510\n\nOK\nAT+CGMR\nV 04.12\n28-08-02\nNPM-9\n(c) NMP.\n\nOK"

    "title": "xterm, zsh, spawn-new-terminal, *BSD",
    "section": "",
    "text": "xterm defines a very convenient action called spawn-new-terminal(). Using that action you can duplicate your current terminal and obtain a shell in your current working directory even if you’re inside a program like vim or mutt.\nFrom the man page:\n   spawn-new-terminal(params)\n           Spawn  a  new xterm process.  This is available on\n           systems which have a modern version of the process\n           filesystem, e.g., \"/proc\", which xterm can read.\n\n           Use the \"cwd\" process entry, e.g., /proc/12345/cwd\n           to obtain the working  directory  of  the  process\n           which is running in the current xterm.\nYou can bind this action to a key using Xresources. For example I bind the action to Alt-n. Here’s the relevant part from my .Xdefaults:\nxterm*VT100.translations: #override \\n\\\n        Meta &lt;Key&gt;n:spawn-new-terminal()\nThe problem is that on *BSD you don’t have a procfs, at least not one that looks like the one on Linux.\nSo to actually get this working, xterm needs another way to find out the current working directory (CWD) of the shell that runs inside of it. I found out that this is not so easy and after some tinkering I decided to go for a dirty hack. The idea is, if I can’t find out the cwd of a zsh process on my own then perhaps I can ask zsh gently to tell it.\nZsh, like any other shell, lets you define functions, however certain functions have a special meaning for zsh: they define hooks. We use 2 hooks here: chpwd(), called whenever the CWD of zsh changes, and zshexit(), called when the shell quits.\nHere are the relevant parts from my .zshrc:\nfunction chpwd()\n{\n    echo -n ${PWD} &gt; ${HOME}/.zsh/${PPID}.pwd\n}\n#call chpwd once on startup\nchpwd\n\nfunction zshexit()\n{\n    rm ${HOME}/.zsh/${PPID}.pwd\n}\nNow for the xterm part. The relevant function is HandleSpawnTerminal() in misc.c. Here’s my modified version:\n#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;\n#include &lt;pwd.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n#include &lt;limits.h&gt;\n#include &lt;err.h&gt;\n\n/* ARGSUSED */\nvoid\nHandleSpawnTerminal(Widget w GCC_UNUSED,\n            XEvent * event GCC_UNUSED,\n            String * params,\n            Cardinal *nparams)\n{\n    static char zshdir[] = \".zsh\";\n    static char termpath[] = \"xterm\";\n\n    pid_t pid, forkpid;\n    uid_t uid;\n    struct passwd *passwd;\n\n    char pathname[_POSIX_PATH_MAX];\n    char zshcwd[_POSIX_PATH_MAX];\n\n    char *home;\n    FILE *fp;\n\n    pid = getpid();\n\n    uid = geteuid();\n    passwd = getpwuid(uid);\n    home = passwd-&gt;pw_dir;\n\n    snprintf(pathname, sizeof pathname, \"%s/%s/%ld.pwd\", home, zshdir, (long)pid);\n\n    fp = fopen(pathname, \"r\");\n    if(fp == NULL)\n    {\n        warn(\"couldn't open %s\", pathname);\n        return;\n    }\n    if(fgets(zshcwd, sizeof zshcwd, fp) == NULL)\n    {\n        warn(\"couldn't read from %s\", pathname);\n        fclose(fp);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    fclose(fp);\n\n    /* The reaper will take care of cleaning up the child */\n    forkpid = fork();\n    if(forkpid &lt; 0)\n    {\n        warn(\"Could not fork\");\n        return;\n    }\n    if(forkpid == 0)\n    {\n        /* We are the child */\n        if(chdir(zshcwd) &lt; 0)\n            err(1, \"could not chdir to %s\", zshcwd);\n\n        unsigned myargc = *nparams + 1;\n        char **myargv = TypeMallocN(char *, myargc + 1);\n        unsigned n = 0;\n\n        myargv[n++] = termpath;\n\n        while (n &lt; myargc) {\n            myargv[n++] = *params++;\n        }\n\n        myargv[n] = 0;\n        execvp(termpath, myargv);\n\n        /* If we get here, we've failed */\n        err(1, \"exec of '%s'\", termpath);\n    } else {\n        /* We are the parent\n         * we just live our life */\n    }\n}\nNow you just have to reconfigure xterm with –enable-exec-xterm and build it."

    "title": "RFLink 433 MHz RF Gateway",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this blog post I would like to share my custom RFLink gateway built on top of the RobotDyn Mega 2560 PRO board. You can see the Mega 2560 PRO as an Arduino Mega clone using a more efficient board layout in order to achieve a smaller board size while still exposing all the relevant features of the microcontroller.\nI designed a daughter board using KiCAD with the instructions from the RFLink website in order to place the RF parts. I used the Aurel RTX MID 5v transceiver which is recommended by the RFLink team. The fact that it contains receiver and transmitter on the same board simplifies the wiring and enables you to use only one antenna. You could however use any other 433 Mhz RF TX/RX components as described on the site.\nHere is the full component list for this project:\n\nMEGA 2560 PRO Board\nCustom PCB\n100nF ceramic capacitor\n10k resistor\nBi-directional logic level converter\nSMA edge connector\n433 Mhz SMA antenna\n\nThe MEGA 2560 PRO board uses 3.3V logic levels internally and is not compatible with 5V logic, even though it is powered from 5V USB. It has an on-board LDO converter which provides 3.3V. This means it is not possible to directly hook up the Aurel RTX MID 5v transceiver which works on 5V. I added a bi-directional logic level converter to the design for this reason, in order to be able to get the devices to talk to each other. When looking around on the Internet, I saw that there is actually a 3.3V version of the Aurel RTX MID (called Aurel RTX MID 3v), which you could hook up directly. However, the 3.3V version appears to be even more difficult to find from resellers than the 5V version, so I went with the 5V version.\nIn order to program the Mega board, I used an AVR programmer. I went for the AVRISP mkII. I don’t think this should be necessary since the board should come preflashed with the Arduino bootloader and you should be able to flash it directly over USB. Mine did not have an Arduino bootloader but this can be due to the fact that I tinkered with it in the past.\nYou need to download the RFLink firmware and extract the RFLink.cpp.hex file which contains the actual binary firmware. (Note that RFLink is not an open source project. The source code for the firmware is not available. They do provide the source code for an old version of the firmware though).\nAfter you extracted the firmware, you can flash it directly over USB using the following command:\navrdude -p atmega2560 -c stk500v2 -P /dev/ttyUSBx -b 115200 -D -Uflash:w:RFLink.cpp.hex:i   \nor you can use the AVRISP mkII programmer using this command:\navrdude -p atmega2560 -c avrispmkII -D -U flash:w:RFLink.cpp.hex:i\nIf you run on Windows, you can also use the GUI tool provided in the firmware archive.\nMy KiCAD project for the daughter board is available here : https://framagit.org/jaj/rflink-gateway.\nYou can order the PCB directly from OSH Park here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/cp3NoWn5.\nMost parts and devices listed above can be found very cheap from Chinese resellers.\nAfter you completed the board, it is possible to hook it up to home automation software over USB. At my place, I use it together with Home Assistant and a Raspberry Pi in order to control smart sockets.\nHere is a view of the fully assembled board. Maybe at some point I will design a box for it.\nUpdate August 2025: it’s been running flawlessly for 6 years. I haven’t designed a box yet.\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://robotdyn.com/catalog/arduino/boards/matrix-led-8x8-module-32x32mm-driver-max7219-7221.html\nhttp://www.rflink.nl/blog2/wiring\nhttps://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009\nhttps://oshpark.com/shared_projects/cp3NoWn5\nhttps://framagit.org/jaj/rflink-gateway"

This technique, while not limited to anesthesia, has seen wide application only in the perioperative setting where anesthesia related drugs are infused to obtain a stable sedation when total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is used.\nTCI is based on pharmacometric models called PKPD models for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. These models describe the drug distribution and metabolism through the body (pharmacokinetics) and the effect of the drug on the body (pharmacodynamics).

The best known software is NONMEM but numerous others are available, even open source software such as nlmixr22.\nMost PKPD models for anesthesia are compartmental models with 3 compartments.

Additionally, the algorithms used for TCI, which needs to inverse PKPD models, are less well known.\nCurrently, the only open source TCI software I’m aware of is the STANPUMP system from the 1990s.\nIn this series of blog posts, I will take a deep dive into the STANPUMP source code to try and understand the algorithms involved and see if I can implement them in a modern fashion. The aim is to understand the algorithms and have a minimal open source implementation from which to work."

This is a driver that can be attached to a serial device and which interprets NMEA 0183 data typically produced by GPS devices. It extracts time data (not position) from the GPS stream and makes it available through the OpenBSD sensors framework. This timedelta sensor can then be used by OpenNTPD to keep your clock in sync. Now I have a Neo Freerunner smartphone which comes with a GPS device that produces NMEA data and I wanted to test it out.\nFirst of all on the phone side you have to power on the GPS device, for example like this:\necho 1 &gt; /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/pcf50633-regltr.7/neo1973-pm-gps.0/power_on\nThen you need to transfer the GPS data from the phone to your OpenBSD machine and emulate a serial device that provides the data.\nsocat (net/socat) does a great job at this. On the phone side make sure GPSD is running and do something like the this:\nsocat EXEC:\"gpspipe -r\" TCP-LISTEN:31415\nalternatively you can talk to the raw device without GPSD like that:\nsocat /dev/ttySAC1,raw,echo=0,crnl TCP-LISTEN:31415\nNow on the computer side you need to attach this to a pseudo terminal:\nsocat TCP:192.168.0.14:31415 /dev/ptypa,raw,echo=0,crnl\nYou should now be able to query the GPS device on your computer. Attach the nmea(4) discipline to the serial device using:\nldattach nmea /dev/ttypa\nIf everything worked fine you should see an nmea sensor come up which you can query using sysctl or systat for example.\nHere’s my relevant output from systat:\nSENSOR                                          VALUE  STATUS  DESCRIPTION\nnmea0.percent0                                100.00%    OK    Signal\nnmea0.timedelta0                              2.237 s    OK    GPS autonomous\nTo use this sensor with OpenNTPD you simply need to add the following to /etc/ntpd.conf:\nsensor nmea0\nntpd is opportunistic about the timedelta sensors, meaning it will use them when they are available but will run just as smooth when they are not.\nHere’s some ntpd output:\nsensor nmea0 added (weight 1, correction 0.000000, refstr HARD)\nsensor nmea0: offset -2.236736\nI advise you to read the relevant man pages to get a better understanding of the process."
