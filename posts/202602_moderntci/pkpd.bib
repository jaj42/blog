NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family. NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs. It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required. It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]},

	abstract = {Background. There is considerable variability in the inter-patient response to norepinephrine. Pharmacokinetic studies of dopamine infusion in volunteers and in patients have also shown large variability. The purpose of this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of norepinephrine in septic shock and trauma patients.
Methods. After Ethical Committee approval and written informed family consent, 12 patients with septic shock and 11 trauma patients requiring norepinephrine infusion were studied. Norepinephrine dose was increased in three successive steps of 0.1 mg kg−1 min−1 at 15-min intervals (20\% maximum allowed increase in arterial pressure). Arterial blood was sampled before and at 0.5, 13, and 15 min after each infusion rate change and 30 s, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after return to baseline dosing. Norepinephrine was assayed by HPLC. The pharmacokinetics were modelled using NONMEM (one-compartment model). The effects of group, body weight (BW), gender and SAPS II (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) [Le Gall JR, Lemeshow S, Saulnier F. A new Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) based on a European/North American multicenter study. J Am Med Assoc 1993; 270: 2957–63] patients score on clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) were tested.
Results. Group, gender, and BW did not influence CL or V. CL was negatively related to SAPS II. CL and T1/2 varied from 3 litre min−1 and 2 min, respectively, when SAPS II=20 to 0.9 litre min−1 and 6.8 min when SAPS II=60.
Conclusion. In trauma patients and in septic shock patients, norepinephrine clearance is negatively related to SAPS II.},

	volume = {20},
	issn = {0090-3493},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between iv infusion rate, plasma concentrations, and hemodynamic and metabolic actions of norepinephrine.
DESIGN: Norepinephrine was administered by using five iv infusion rates (0.01 to 0.2 micrograms/kg/min) for 30 mins each to eight volunteers, for the purpose of constructing cumulative plasma concentration-response curves.
SETTING: Laboratory of the Department of Anesthesiology at a university hospital.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, and the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and insulin were measured at the end of each infusion rate. During the highest infusion rate, plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased from 199 +/- 75 to 7475 +/- 1071 pg/mL (1.18 +/- 0.44 to 44.18 +/- 6.33 nmol/L). Typical hemodynamic responses, such as increases in BP and decreases in heart rate, were seen, while the plasma concentrations of glucose and nonesterified fatty acids increased from 92 +/- 10 to 132 +/- 17 mg/dL (5.1 +/- 0.6 to 7.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/L) and 11 +/- 4 to 34 +/- 6 mg/dL (0.11 +/- 0.04 to 0.34 +/- 0.06 g/L), respectively, during the 0.2 micrograms/kg/min infusion rate (p less than .05). Despite the increase in glucose concentration, insulin remained at baseline values. Metabolic and hemodynamic effects occurred at similar plasma concentrations throughout the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of norepinephrine showed no selective hemodynamic actions. The metabolic responses observed in this investigation were similar to those responses seen during increased endogenous sympathetic nervous system activity, such as stress, exercise, or trauma.},

	abstract = {Recently we have shown that arterial norepinephrine (NE) concentration increases significantly during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) of -15 mmHg. Interestingly, the increase was found to be related predominantly to a decrease in arterial NE clearance. We postulated that this reduction in clearance would be related to a reduction in cardiac output. Accordingly, we measured both cardiac output (2-dimensional echocardiographic/Doppler technique) and arterial NE kinetics ([3H]NE continuous infusion radiotracer technique) during LBNP of -15 mmHg. These measures of cardiac output and arterial NE spillover and clearance were obtained in 12 normal subjects at baseline, 5 and 10 min (Early) and 25 and 30 min (Late) of LBNP. We found that arterial NE concentration increased significantly, by 25\% Early and 22\% Late (P = 0.001). Spillover, however, did not change (P = 0.258), whereas clearance decreased by 12\% Early and 19\% Late (P = 0.014), and cardiac output decreased by 15\% Early and 19\% Late (P = 0.001). These reductions in clearance and cardiac output correlated significantly (r = 0.61, P = 0.001). No correlation was noted between spillover and cardiac output (r = 0.027, P = 0.874). We conclude that the increases in arterial NE concentration during nonhypotensive LBNP are predominantly due to decreased cardiac output with resultant decreases in systemic clearance of NE. These findings suggest that the ability to clear NE from the circulation is linked to the level of cardiac output and that low cardiac output states by themselves may lead to an elevation in arterial plasma NE concentrations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dopamine and norepinephrine.
DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, trial.
SETTING: Neurosciences critical care unit.
PATIENTS: Eight patients with a head injury, requiring dopamine or norepinephrine infusions to support cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
INTERVENTION: Patients received in randomised order, either dopamine or norepinephrine to achieve and maintain a CPP of 70 mmHg, and then, following a 30-min period of stable haemodynamics, a CPP of 90 mmHg. Data were then acquired using the second agent. Haemodynamic measurements were made during each period and a blood sample was obtained at the end of each study period for analysis of plasma catecholamine concentrations
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Plasma levels of norepinephrine and dopamine were significantly related to infusion rates but did not have a simple linear relationship to haemodynamic parameters. However, there was a significant quadratic relationship between the infusion rate of dopamine and cardiac index (r2=0.431), and systemic vascular resistance index (r2=0.605), with a breakpoint (at which cardiac index reduced and SVRI increased) at a dopamine plasma level of approximately 50 nM/l (corresponding to an infusion rate of approximately 15 microg.kg(-1).min(-1)).
CONCLUSIONS: Norepinephrine and dopamine have predictable pharmacokinetics; however, those of dopamine do not fit a simple first-order kinetic model. The pharmacodynamic effects of dopamine and norepinephrine show much inter-individual variability and unpredictability. Plasma levels of dopamine appear to relate to variations in adrenergic receptor effects with break points that reflect expectations from infusion-rate related pharmacodynamics.},

The aim of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of norepinephrine in hypotensive critically ill children, including associated variability factors.

Methods
This was a prospective study in an 18-bed neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit. All children were aged less than 18 years, weighed more than 1500 g and required norepinephrine for systemic arterial hypotension. The pharmacokinetics and haemodynamic effects were described using the non-linear mixed effect modelling software MONOLIX.

Results
Norepinephrine dosing infusions ranging from 0.05 to 2 μg kg−1 min−1 were administered to 38 children whose weight ranged from 2 to 85 kg. A one compartment open model with linear elimination adequately described the norepinephrine concentration–time courses. Bodyweight (BW) was the main covariate influencing norepinephrine clearance (CL) and endogenous norepinephrine production rate (q0) via an allometric relationship: CL(BWi) = θCL × (BWi)3/4 and q0(BWi) = θq0 × (BWi)3/4. The increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) as a function of norepinephrine concentration was well described using an Emax model. The effects of post-conceptional age (PCA) and number of organ dysfunctions were significant on basal MAP level (MAP0i = MAP0 × PCA/9i0.166) and on the maximal increase in MAP (32 mmHg and 12 mmHg for a number of organ dysfunctions ≤3 and ≥4, respectively).

Conclusion
The pharmacokinetics and haemodynamic effects of norepinephrine in hypotensive critically ill children highlight the between-subject variability which is related to the substantial role of age, BW and severity of illness. Taking into account these individual characteristics may help clinicians in determining an appropriate initial a priori dosing regimen.},

The tri-exponential drug concentration decay complicates the definition of therapeutic dosage regimens and prevents straightforward prediction of recovery from drug effects. The context-sensitive half-time, the time required for drug blood concentration to decrease to half its value, provides a useful comparative predictor of drug concentration decline after infusion. The effect-site equilibration time contributes to the delay of drug effect and intensifies the disequilibrium between drug blood concentrations and obtained effect following incremental dosage. The rationale for drug infusion is reduction of fluctuating drug concentrations and drug effects. A variability similar to that observed with the use of inhalation agents, must be achieved by the choice of an appropriate pharmacokinetic model. The use of a target controlled infusion device, delivering proportional changes based on pharmacokinetic principles, allows titration of the concentration against clinical effect in individual patients.},

A nonlinear regression analysis evaluating the effect of six concomitant variables revealed a significant influence of body weight on the volume of the central compartment (Vc), and a decrease with age of total body clearance (CL) and of redistribution rate from the deep compartment (k31). A small but significant effect of sex on the Vc was also observed. The duration of anesthesia and the concomitant administration of inhalational anesthetics had no effect on alfentanil pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean CL and Vc for alfentanil in a 70-kg male, aged less than 40 yr, were estimated as 0.356 l/min and 7.77 l, respectively. After correction for age, body weight, and sex, the remaining interindividual variability of alfentanil kinetics (expressed as coefficient of variation) was 48\% for CL and 33\% for Vc. These population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates should increase the accuracy of predicting concentration-time profiles for intravenous alfentanil infusions.

	abstract = {A model is presented that highlights the principal factors determining the form and extent of contraction in arteries upon stimulation of their sympathetic nerve supply. This model incorporates a previous quantitative model of the process of noradrenaline (NAd) diffusion into the vascular media and reuptake into sympathetic varicosities during nerve stimulation (J. Theor. Biol. 226 (2004) 359). It is also dependent on a model of how the subsequent activation of metabotropic receptors initiates a G-protein cascade, resulting in the production of inositol trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) and an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, [ Ca 2 + ] i , in the smooth muscle cells (J. Theor. Biol. 223 (2003) 93). In the present work we couple this rise in [ Ca 2 + ] i to the increase in phosphorylated myosin bound to actin in the cells and hence determine the force development in arteries due to nerve stimulation. The model accounts for force development as a function of [ Ca 2 + ] i and for the rate of change of force as a function of the rate of change of [ Ca 2 + ] i in single smooth muscle cells. It also accounts for the characteristic time course of the force developed by the media of the rat-tail artery upon nerve stimulation. This consists of a rapid rise to a transient peak followed by a sustained plateau of contraction during the stimulation period, after which the contraction slowly decays back to baseline at a rate dependent on the strength of the stimulation. The model indicates that the transient peak is primarily due to the partial block of the IP 3 receptor by the rise in [ Ca 2 + ] i and that the main determinant of the equilibrium condition indicated by the plateau phase is the rate of pumping of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The relatively slow decline of contraction at the end of nerve stimulation is primarily a consequence of the slow rates of removal of NAd from the media by diffusion and reuptake into the sympathetic varicosities. The model thus provides a quantitative account of vascular smooth muscle contraction upon sympathetic nerve stimulation.},

	abstract = {Introduction
In septic patients, an unpredictable response to epinephrine may be due to pharmacodynamic factors or to non-linear pharmacokinetics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of epinephrine and its determinants in patients with septic shock.

Methods
Thirty-eight consecutive adult patients with septic shock were prospectively recruited immediately before epinephrine infusion. A baseline blood sample (C0) was taken to assess endogenous epinephrine, norepinephrine, renin, aldosterone, and plasma cortisol levels before epinephrine infusion. At a fixed cumulative epinephrine dose adjusted to body weight and under steady-state infusion, a second blood sample (C1) was taken to assess epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. Data were analyzed using the nonlinear mixed effect modeling software program NONMEM.

Results
Plasma epinephrine concentrations ranged from 4.4 to 540 nmol/L at steady-state infusion (range 0.1 to 7 mg/hr; 0.026 to 1.67 μg/kg/min). A one-compartment model adequately described the data. Only body weight (BW) and New Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPSII) at intensive care unit admission significantly influenced epinephrine clearance: CL (L/hr) = 127 × (BW/70)0.60 × (SAPS II/50)-0.67. The corresponding half-life was 3.5 minutes. Endogenous norepinephrine plasma concentration significantly decreased during epinephrine infusion (median (range) 8.8 (1 – 56.7) at C0 vs. 4.5 (0.3 – 38.9) nmol/L at C1, P {\textless} 0.001).

Conclusions
Epinephrine pharmacokinetics is linear in septic shock patients, without any saturation at high doses. Basal neurohormonal status does not influence epinephrine pharmacokinetics. Exogenous epinephrine may alter the endogenous norepinephrine metabolism in septic patients.},

	title = {The influence of method of administration and covariates on the pharmacokinetics of propofol in adult volunteers},
	volume = {88},
	issn = {0003-3022},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unresolved issues with propofol include whether the pharmacokinetics are linear with dose, are influenced by method of administration (bolus vs. infusion), or are influenced by age. Recently, a new formulation of propofol emulsion, containing disodium edetate (EDTA), was introduced in the United States. Addition of EDTA was found by the manufacturer to significantly reduce bacterial growth. This study investigated the influences of method of administration, infusion rate, patient covariates, and EDTA on the pharmacokinetics of propofol.
METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers aged 26-81 yr were given a bolus dose of propofol, followed 1 h later by a 60-min infusion. Each volunteer was randomly assigned to an infusion rate of 25, 50, 100, or 200 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Each volunteer was studied twice under otherwise identical circumstances: once receiving propofol without EDTA and once receiving propofol with EDTA. The influence of the method of administration and of the volunteer covariates was explored by fitting a three-compartment mamillary model to the data. The influence of EDTA was investigated by direct comparison of the measured concentrations in both sessions.
RESULTS: The concentrations of propofol with and without EDTA were not significantly different. The concentration measurements after the bolus dose were significantly underpredicted by the parameters obtained just from the infusion data. The kinetics of propofol were linear within the infusion range of 25-200 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Age was a significant covariate for Volume2 and Clearance2, as were weight, height, and lean body mass for the metabolic clearance.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that method of administration (bolus vs. infusion), but not EDTA, influences the pharmacokinetics of propofol. Within the clinically relevant range, the kinetics of propofol during infusions are linear regarding infusion rate.},

We describe an attempt to address these challenges through design, implementation, and evaluation of a PCLC device for delivering medically-induced coma, with the intention to eventually conduct a clinical trial. This device works by automatically adjusting the infusion rate of propofol – a general anesthetic – in response to an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern called burst suppression. We also designed and implemented a computational patient model which interfaces with hardware and produces realistic EEG signals in response to propofol infusion. The computational patient model is used in hardware-in-the-loop studies to evaluate the behavior of our PCLC device under realistic perturbations. Finally, we have tested the performance of our PCLC device in rodents. Results from these studies suggest that closed-loop control of medically-induced coma in humans is feasible and robust. Consequently, our work produced a PCLC device and relevant pre-clinical evidence in support of a pilot clinical trial.},

The current study was to investigate the effects of sevoflurane (SEVO) and isoflurane (ISO) on KCl-elicited PI3KC2α mediated vasoconstriction in rat aortic smooth muscle.
METHODS: Isometric force, in the absence or presence of SEVO or ISO (1 {\textasciitilde} 3 minimum alveolar concentration, MAC), PI3K inhibitor LY294002, Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632, and membrane translocation of PI3K-p85, PI3K-C2α, Rho kinase (Rock II), or phosphorylation of MYPT1/Thr853, MYPT1/Thr696, CPI-17/Thr38 and MLC in response to KCl (60 mM) was measured by using isometric force transducer and western blotting analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: KCl elicited a rapid and sustained contraction of rat aortic smooth muscle that was inhibited by both SEVO and ISO in a concentration-dependent manner, and also suppressed by LY294002 (1 mM) and Y27632 (1 uM). LY294002 (1 mM) and Y27632 (1 uM) also inhibited KCl-induced MLC phosphorylation. LY294002 (1 mM) inhibited KCl-induced PI3K-p85, PI3K-C2α membrane translocation in response to KCl (p {\textless}0.05, p {\textless} 0.01, respectively). Not only Y27632 (1 uM), but also LY294002 (1 mM), inhibited KCl-induced Rock-II membrane translocation (p {\textless} 0.01). SEVO and ISO inhibited KCl-stimulated MLC phosphorylation, PI3K-C2α and Rock-II,not PI3K p85 membrane translocation in a concentration-dependent manner in rat aorta. Both SEVO and ISO suppressed the MYPT1/Thr853, not MYPT1/Thr696 and CPI-17/Thr38, MLC phosphorylation in response to KCl.
CONCLUSION: PI3K-C2α mediates part of SEVO and ISO-mediated vasodilation in rat aorta. The cellular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of volatile anesthetics might be mediated by KCl/PI3K-C2α/Rho kinase/MYPT1/MLC pathway.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide (CVR-CO2) reflects cerebrovascular reserve capacity, which is important in many brain disorders, including cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's diseases. Meanwhile, there is a relationship between CVR-CO2and cognitive function. Therefore, the study is aimed at investigating the effects of sevoflurane versus propofol on CVR-CO2during laparoscopic surgery, as well as the role of CVR-CO2on cognitive function during perioperative period.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight patients, aged 18-65 years undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were randomly assigned to group S and group P. The patients in group S were induced with propofol and maintained with sevoflurane. The patients in group P were induced and maintained with propofol (target-controlled infusion). Remifentanil was given to both groups. CVR-CO2at baseline (before induction), before pneumoperitoneum and during pneumoperitoneum, as well as Mini-Mental State Examination scores at baseline and 24 hours after surgery were recorded.
RESULTS: In group S, CVR-CO2before and during pneumoperitoneum increased significantly compared with baseline (P{\textless}0.05). In group P, CVR-CO2before pneumoperitoneum increased significantly (P{\textless}0.05), but CVR-CO2during pneumoperitoneum was not different compared with baseline. In either group, there was no significant correlation between mean blood pressure and CVR-CO2during surgery, and there was no significant difference between Mini-Mental State Examination scores at baseline and 24 hours after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane could maintain CVR-CO2at a higher level during pneumoperitoneum in surgery. Therefore, in patients with impaired cerebrovascular reserve capacity, inhaled anesthetic could be a priority strategy for anesthesia maintenance to improve the compensatory vasodilation ability of cerebral small vessels.},

	abstract = {The effects of desflurane on endothelium-dependent vasodilation remain uncertain, whereas sevoflurane is known to inhibit it. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is mainly mediated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The effects of desflurane on endothelium-dependent vasodilation were compared with those of sevoflurane, and inhibition mechanisms, including phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and the calcium pathway, were evaluated for the two anesthetics. We hypothesized that desflurane would inhibit endothelium-dependent vasodilation in a concentration-dependent manner more than sevoflurane, with inhibition of a calcium pathway. Isolated rat aortic rings were randomly assigned to treatment with desflurane or sevoflurane for measurements of the vasodilation ratio. To determine NO production with desflurane and sevoflurane, an in vitro assay was performed with cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. These cells were also used for measurement of intracellular calcium or Western blotting. For endothelium-dependent vasodilation, the ratio of vasodilation was more significantly inhibited by 11.4\% desflurane than by 4.8\% sevoflurane. Inhibition did not between 5.7\% desflurane and 2.4\% sevoflurane. No inhibitory effect of desflurane or sevoflurane was observed in endothelium-denuded aorta. Desflurane inhibited nitric oxide production caused by stimulation of bradykinin significantly more than sevoflurane. Desflurane had a greater suppressive effect on the bradykinin-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentration than did sevoflurane. Sevoflurane, but not desflurane, inhibited phosphorylation of the serine 1177 residue by bradykinin stimulation. Desflurane inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation more than sevoflurane through inhibition of a calcium pathway. Sevoflurane inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation by inhibition of phosphorylation of the serine 1177 residue of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels of the A1 (TRPA1) and V1 (TRPV1) subtypes are key regulators of vasomotor tone. Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic known to cause vasorelaxation. Our objectives were to examine the extent to which TRPA1 and/or TRPV1 ion channels mediate propofol-induced depressor responses in vivo and to delineate the signaling pathway(s) involved.
METHODS: Mice were subjected to surgery under 1.5-2.5\% sevoflurane gas with supplemental oxygen. After a stable baseline in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was achieved propofol (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg/min) was administered to assess the hemodynamic actions of the intravenous anesthetic. The effect of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition with L-NAME and/or calcium-gated K+ channel (BKCa) inhibition with Penetrim A (Pen A), alone and in combination, on propofol-induced decreases in mean arterial pressure were assessed in control C57Bl/6J, TRPA1-/-, TRPV1-/- and double-knockout mice (TRPAV-/-).
RESULTS: Propofol decreased MAP in control mice and this effect was markedly attenuated in TRPA1-/- and TRPAV-/- mice but unaffected in TRPV1-/-mice. Moreover, pretreatment with L-NAME or Pen A attenuated the decrease in MAP in control and TRPV1-/- mice, and combined inhibition abolished the depressor response. In contrast, the markedly attenuated propofol-induced depressor response observed in TRPA1-/- and TRPAV-/- mice was unaffected by pre-treatment with Pen A or L-NAME when used either alone or in combination.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate for the first time that propofol-induced depressor responses in vivo are predominantly mediated by TRPA1 ion channels with no involvement of TRPV1 ion channels and includes activation of both NOS and BKCa channels.},

	abstract = {Shock occurs when failure of the cardiovascular system compromises tissue perfusion. When fluid administration fails to restore adequate arterial pressure and organ perfusion in patients with shock, therapy with vasoactive agents should be initiated. The key to selecting among vasoactive agents is to make the choice in the context of the goals of therapy. The ultimate goals of hemodynamic therapy in shock are to restore effective tissue perfusion and to normalize cellular metabolism. The clinician needs to consider ways of achieving those goals and the mechanisms of action of potential therapies. Armed with this knowledge, it becomes easier to match the mechanism of action of a particular agent to the goals of therapy. When this is done, differences among various agents are seen primarily as differences in mechanisms of action, and discussions about which agent is "best" are transformed into consideration of which agent is best suited to implement the therapeutic strategy that has been selected in a given clinical context. Despite the complex pathophysiology of shock, use of vasoactive agents for hemodynamic support of patients with shock can be guided by an underlying approach in which clinicians define specific goals and end points, titrate therapies to those end points, and evaluate the results of their interventions on an ongoing basis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraoperative hypotension may contribute to postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and myocardial injury, but what blood pressures are unsafe is unclear. The authors evaluated the association between the intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the risk of AKI and myocardial injury.
METHODS: The authors obtained perioperative data for 33,330 noncardiac surgeries at the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio. The authors evaluated the association between intraoperative MAP from less than 55 to 75 mmHg and postoperative AKI and myocardial injury to determine the threshold of MAP where risk is increased. The authors then evaluated the association between the duration below this threshold and their outcomes adjusting for potential confounding variables.
RESULTS: AKI and myocardial injury developed in 2,478 (7.4\%) and 770 (2.3\%) surgeries, respectively. The MAP threshold where the risk for both outcomes increased was less than 55 mmHg. Compared with never developing a MAP less than 55 mmHg, those with a MAP less than 55 mmHg for 1-5, 6-10, 11-20, and more than 20 min had graded increases in their risk of the two outcomes (AKI: 1.18 [95\% CI, 1.06-1.31], 1.19 [1.03-1.39], 1.32 [1.11-1.56], and 1.51 [1.24-1.84], respectively; myocardial injury 1.30 [1.06-1.5], 1.47 [1.13-1.93], 1.79 [1.33-2.39], and 1.82 [1.31-2.55], respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: Even short durations of an intraoperative MAP less than 55 mmHg are associated with AKI and myocardial injury. Randomized trials are required to determine whether outcomes improve with interventions that maintain an intraoperative MAP of at least 55 mmHg.},

	abstract = {Background
              Postoperative stroke is a rare but major complication after surgery. The most often proposed mechanism is an embolus originating from the heart or great vessels. The role of intraoperative hypotension in the occurrence and evolution of postoperative stroke is largely unknown.
            
            
              Methods
              A case-control study was conducted among 48,241 patients who underwent noncardiac and nonneurosurgical procedures in the period from January 2002 to June 2009. A total of 42 stroke cases (0.09\%) were matched on age and type of surgery to 252 control patients. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of the duration of intraoperative hypotension (defined according to a range of blood pressure thresholds) on the occurrence of an ischemic stroke within 10 days after surgery, adjusted for potential confounding factors.
            
            
              Results
              After correction for potential confounders and multiple testing, the duration that the mean blood pressure was decreased more than 30\% from baseline remained statistically significantly associated with the occurrence of a postoperative stroke.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Intraoperative hypotension might play a role in the development of postoperative ischemic stroke. Especially for mean blood pressure values decreasing more than 30\% from baseline blood pressure, an association with postoperative ischemic stroke risks was observed.},

	abstract = {Importance: Perioperative hypotension is associated with an increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality, but the appropriate management strategy remains uncertain.
Objective: To evaluate whether an individualized blood pressure management strategy tailored to individual patient physiology could reduce postoperative organ dysfunction.
Design, Setting, and Participants: The Intraoperative Norepinephrine to Control Arterial Pressure (INPRESS) study was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial conducted in 9 French university and nonuniversity hospitals. Adult patients (n = 298) at increased risk of postoperative complications with a preoperative acute kidney injury risk index of class III or higher (indicating moderate to high risk of postoperative kidney injury) undergoing major surgery lasting 2 hours or longer under general anesthesia were enrolled from December 4, 2012, through August 28, 2016 (last follow-up, September 28, 2016).
Interventions: Individualized management strategy aimed at achieving a systolic blood pressure (SBP) within 10\% of the reference value (ie, patient's resting SBP) or standard management strategy of treating SBP less than 80 mm Hg or lower than 40\% from the reference value during and for 4 hours following surgery.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and dysfunction of at least 1 organ system of the renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and neurologic systems by day 7 after surgery. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome, durations of ICU and hospital stay, adverse events, and all-cause mortality at 30 days after surgery.
Results: Among 298 patients who were randomized, 292 patients completed the trial (mean [SD] age, 70 [7] years; 44 [15.1\%] women) and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome event occurred in 56 of 147 patients (38.1\%) assigned to the individualized treatment strategy vs 75 of 145 patients (51.7\%) assigned to the standard treatment strategy (relative risk, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.56 to 0.94; P = .02; absolute risk difference, -14\%, 95\% CI, -25\% to -2\%). Sixty-eight patients (46.3\%) in the individualized treatment group and 92 (63.4\%) in the standard treatment group had postoperative organ dysfunction by day 30 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 0.84; P = .001). There were no significant between-group differences in severe adverse events or 30-day mortality.
Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients predominantly undergoing abdominal surgery who were at increased postoperative risk, management targeting an individualized systolic blood pressure, compared with standard management, reduced the risk of postoperative organ dysfunction.

	abstract = {Agonist-induced sequestration and internalization of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors were examined in DDT1 MF-2 cells. Pretreatment of cells with epinephrine or norepinephrine alone, but not with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate alone, resulted in a marked decrease in [3H]prazosin binding to intact cells at 4 degrees. These pretreatments resulted in little or no change in the fraction of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors exhibiting limited accessibility to the hydrophilic competing ligand epinephrine in short-time competition binding assays with intact cells and little or no change in the subcellular distribution of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors between the plasma membrane and light vesicle compartments as assessed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation assays. Pretreatment with a combination of agonist plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in a greater decrease in [3H]prazosin binding at 4 degrees than was observed when cells were pretreated with agonist alone, induced the conversion of about half of cell surface alpha 1-adrenergic receptors to a form exhibiting limited accessibility to epinephrine in short-time assays, and induced a shift of about half of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors from the plasma membrane fraction to a light vesicle fraction on sucrose density gradients. A similar shift of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors was observed on sucrose density gradients after exposure to agonist plus either mezerein or beta-phorbol didecanoate, but not with agonist plus alpha-phorbol didecanoate, indicating involvement of protein kinase C. These results suggest that pretreatment with agonist alone induces the sequestration of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors into a compartment that is inaccessible to [3H]prazosin at 4 degrees but that is accessible to hydrophilic ligands at 37 degrees and remains associated with the plasma membrane. In contrast, alpha 1-adrenergic receptors are apparently internalized from the plasma membrane to a separate compartment, presumably an intracellular vesicle, when cells are pretreated simultaneously with a combination of agonist plus a protein kinase C activator.},

	abstract = {Informative diagnostic tools are vital to the development of useful mixed-effects models. The Visual Predictive Check (VPC) is a popular tool for evaluating the performance of population PK and PKPD models. Ideally, a VPC will diagnose both the fixed and random effects in a mixed-effects model. In many cases, this can be done by comparing different percentiles of the observed data to percentiles of simulated data, generally grouped together within bins of an independent variable. However, the diagnostic value of a VPC can be hampered by binning across a large variability in dose and/or influential covariates. VPCs can also be misleading if applied to data following adaptive designs such as dose adjustments. The prediction-corrected VPC (pcVPC) offers a solution to these problems while retaining the visual interpretation of the traditional VPC. In a pcVPC, the variability coming from binning across independent variables is removed by normalizing the observed and simulated dependent variable based on the typical population prediction for the median independent variable in the bin. The principal benefit with the pcVPC has been explored by application to both simulated and real examples of PK and PKPD models. The investigated examples demonstrate that pcVPCs have an enhanced ability to diagnose model misspecification especially with respect to random effects models in a range of situations. The pcVPC was in contrast to traditional VPCs shown to be readily applicable to data from studies with a priori and/or a posteriori dose adaptations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Blood Pressure Target in Acute Ischemic Stroke to Reduce Hemorrhage After Endovascular Therapy (BP TARGET) trial evaluated whether an intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) target resulted in reduced rates of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) after successful endovascular therapy (EVT) but did not assess the effect of blood pressure variability (BPV) on functional outcomes and ICH occurrence. We sought to evaluate this question in the BP TARGET trial.
METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of the BP TARGET trial and included patients with at least 50\% of blood pressure (BP) recordings during the first 24 h after EVT. BPV parameters were SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), maximum-minimum (max-min), successive variation (SV), and time rate. The primary outcome was favorable functional outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale between 0 and 2); the secondary outcome was the rate of ICH at 24 h.
RESULTS: We included 290 patients (mean number of BP measures = 30.4, SD = 8.0). BPV parameters (SBPSD , SBPmax-min , SBPCV ) were higher in the intensive SBP target group. Only DBP BPV parameters were associated with worse functional outcomes in the unadjusted model (DBPSD , DBPmax-min , DBPCV , and DBPSV ), but not after adjustment. Higher SBPmax-min was associated with worse functional outcomes in Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2B patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-1.02), but not in patients with complete reperfusion (OR = 1.27, 95\% CI = 0.80-2.02, p for heterogeneity (phet =0.037). None of the BPV parameters was associated with ICH, regardless of the randomization group or the reperfusion grade.
CONCLUSIONS: BPV was significantly higher in the intensive SBP target group but was not associated with functional outcome or ICH.},

              Background
              Norepinephrine has been investigated as a potential alterative to phenylephrine for maintaining blood pressure during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery with the advantage of less depression of maternal heart rate and cardiac output. However, the relative potencies of these two vasopressors have not been fully determined in this context.
            
            
              Methods
              In a random-allocation, graded dose–response study, 180 healthy patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery received a single bolus of norepinephrine in one of six different doses ranging from 4 to 12 µg or phenylephrine in one of six different doses ranging from 60 to 200 µg to treat the first episode of hypotension. The magnitude of response was measured as the percentage of full restoration of systolic blood pressure to the baseline value. Dose–response analysis was performed using nonlinear regression to derive four-parameter logistic dose–response curves, which were compared to determine relative potency.
            
            
              Results
              Data were analyzed for 180 patients. The estimated ED50 values (dose giving a 50\% response) were norepinephrine 10 µg (95\% CI, 6 to 17 µg) and phenylephrine 137 µg (95\% CI, 79 to 236 µg). The estimated relative potency ratio for the two drugs was 13.1 µg (95\% CI, 10.4 to 15.8 µg).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Comparative dose–response analysis was completed for norepinephrine and phenylephrine given as a bolus to treat the first episode of hypotension in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. The estimated dose equivalent to phenylephrine 100 µg was norepinephrine 8 µg (95\% CI, 6 to 10 µg). These results may be useful to inform the design of future comparative studies.},

              EDITOR’S PERSPECTIVE
              
                What We Already Know about This Topic
                Hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery is common, usually treated with phenylephrine or ephedrine
                Norepinephrine was recently introduced in obstetric anesthesia but the optimal dose is unknown
              
              
                What This Article Tells Us That Is New
                This randomized, double-blinded trial compared prophylactic norepinephrine infusions of 0.025, 0.050, or 0.075 μg · kg-1 · min-1, started after bupivacaine spinal anesthesia, in full-term parturients having elective cesarean delivery
                The primary outcome, maternal hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 80\% of baseline), occurred less frequently after both 0.050 and 0.075 μg · kg-1 · min-1 compared 0.025 μg · kg-1 · min-1 norepinephrine
              
            
            
              Background
              Norepinephrine has been recently introduced for prophylaxis against postspinal hypotension during cesarean delivery; however, no data are available regarding its optimum dose. The objective of this study is to compare three infusion rates of norepinephrine for prophylaxis against postspinal hypotension during cesarean delivery.
            
            
              Methods
              The authors conducted a double-blinded, randomized, controlled study including full-term pregnant women scheduled for cesarean delivery. Norepinephrine infusion was commenced after subarachnoid block. Patients were randomized into three groups, which received norepinephrine with starting infusion rates of 0.025 μg · kg-1 · min-1, 0.050 μg · kg-1 · min-1, and 0.075 μg · kg-1 · min-1. Infusion was stopped when intraoperative hypertension occurred. The primary outcome was the frequency of postspinal hypotension (defined as decreased systolic blood pressure less than 80\% of the baseline reading). The three groups were compared according to the following: systolic blood pressure, heart rate, frequency of intraoperative hypertension, frequency of bradycardia, and neonatal outcomes.
            
            
              Results
              Two hundred eighty-four mothers were included in the analysis. The frequency of postspinal hypotension was lower for both the 0.050-μg · kg-1 · min-1 dose group (23/93 [24.7\%], odds ratio: 0.45 [95\% CI: 0.24 to 0.82], P = 0.014) and the 0.075-μg · kg-1 · min-1 dose group (25/96 [26.0\%], odds ratio: 0.48 [95\% CI:0.26 to 0.89], P = 0.022) compared with the 0.025-μg · kg-1 · min-1 dose group (40/95 [42.1\%]). The two higher-dose groups (the 0.050-μg · kg-1 · min-1 group and the 0.075-μg · kg-1 · min-1 group) had higher systolic blood pressure and lower heart rate compared with the 0.025 μg · kg-1 · min-1 group. The three groups were comparable in the frequency of intraoperative hypertension, incidence of bradycardia, and neonatal outcomes.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Both the 0.050-μg · kg-1 · min-1 and 0.075-μg · kg-1 · min-1 norepinephrine infusion rates effectively reduced postspinal hypotension during cesarean delivery compared with the 0.025-μg · kg-1 · min-1 infusion rate.},

	abstract = {The fitting of complex receptor-response data where fractional response and occupancy do not match is challenging. They encompass important cases including (a) the presence of “receptor reserve” and/or partial agonism, (b) multiple responses assessed at different vantage points along a pathway, (c) responses that are different along diverging downstream pathways (biased agonism), and (d) constitutive activity. For these, simple models such as the well-known Clark or Hill equations cannot be used. Those that can, such as the operational (Black\&Leff) model, do not provide a unified approach, have multiple nonintuitive parameters that are challenging to fit in well-defined manner, have difficulties incorporating binding data, and cannot be reduced or connected to simpler forms. We have recently introduced a quantitative receptor model (SABRE) that includes parameters for Signal Amplification (γ), Binding affinity (Kd), Receptor activation Efficacy (ε), and constitutive activity (εR0). It provides a single equation to fit complex cases within a full two-state framework with the possibility of incorporating receptor occupancy data (i.e., experimental Kds). Simpler cases can be fit by using consecutively reduced forms obtained by constraining parameters to specific values, e.g., εR0 = 0: no constitutive activity, γ = 1: no amplification (Emax-type fitting), and ε = 1: no partial agonism (Clark equation). Here, a Hill-type extension is introduced (n ≠ 1), and simulated and experimental receptor-response data from simple to increasingly complex cases are fitted within the unified framework of SABRE with differently constrained parameters.},

Elle constitue un indicateur incontournable de la qualité des soins d’anesthésie. Cependant, il n’existe pas de définition consensuelle de la morbidité sévère de l’anesthésie disponible dans la littérature. L’objectif principal de cette thèse était de réaliser une revue systématique de la littérature pour décrire tous les critères utilisés pour définir la morbidité sévère liée à l’anesthésie Matériel et Méthode : Ont été inclus dans cette revue systématique 2 types d’études, publiées entre 2010 et 2021 : les études observationnelles dont l’objectif principal était d’explorer la morbidité sévère liée à l’anesthésie, et les essais randomisés qui testaient l’efficacité d’une intervention pour prévenir la survenue d’un événement morbide sévère directement lié à l’anesthésie. Les études incluses ont été examinées par deux évaluateurs indépendants afin de relever les différents critères de morbidités. Résultats : Au total, 142 études avec 4 705 719 patients ont été incluses. 68 critères de morbidité sévère secondaires à l’anesthésie ont été identifiés. Parmi ces critères, la mortalité est le plus souvent étudiée (59\%), suivie de l’infarctus du myocarde (36\%), de l’accident vasculaire cérébral (35\%) et de la pneumopathie (33\%). Lorsque les critères étudiés étaient composites, les associations les plus fréquemment retrouvées étaient, en proportions similaires, la mortalité + l’infarctus du myocarde (30\%), la mortalité + l’accident vasculaire cérébral (30\%), et l’infarctus du myocarde + l’accident vasculaire cérébral (28\%). Discussion : Ce travail a permis d’identifier et de classer tous les critères utilisés dans la littérature pour définir la morbidité sévère liée à l’anesthésie. Il constitue la première étape d’un projet national plus large dont le but est de construire par consensus d’experts une définition de la morbidité liée à l’anesthésie., Introduction: Severe morbidity related to anesthesia represents all the serious complications that result directly from an anesthetic procedure. It is an essential indicator of anesthesia quality of care. However, there is no consensus definition of severe morbidity of anesthesia available in the literature. The main objective of this thesis was to perform a systematic review of the literature to describe all the criteria used to define severe anesthesia-related morbidity. Material and method: Two types of studies, published between 2010 and 2021, were included in this systematic review: observational studies whose primary objective was to explore severe anesthesia-related morbidity, and randomized trials that tested the efficacy of an intervention to prevent the occurrence of severe anesthetic morbidity. The included studies were reviewed by two independent reviewers to identify different morbidity criteria. Results: Overall, 142 studies with 4,705,719 patients were included. 68 criteria of severe morbidity secondary to anesthesia were identified. Among these criteria, mortality was the most frequently studied (59\%), followed by myocardial infarction (36\%), stroke (35\%), and pneumopathy (33\%). When the criteria studied were composite, the most frequent associations found in similar proportions were mortality + myocardial infarction (30\%), mortality + stroke (30\%), and myocardial infarction + stroke (28\%). Discussion: This work identified and classified all the criteria used in the literature to define severe anesthesia-related morbidity. This is the first step of a large national project aiming at providing an expert consensus definition of anesthesia-related morbidity.},

	abstract = {Background. Target controlled infusion (TCI) systems use population-based pharmacokinetic (PK) models that do not take into account inter-individual residual variation. This study compares the bias and inaccuracy of a population-based vs a personalized TCI propofol titration using Bayesian adaptation. Haemodynamic and hypnotic stability, and the prediction probability of alternative PK models, was studied.
Methods. A double-blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial of 120 subjects undergoing cardiac surgery was conducted. Blood samples were obtained at 10, 35, 50, 65, 75 and 120 min and analysed using a point-of-care propofol blood analyser. Bayesian adaptation of the PK model was applied at 60 min in the intervention group. Median (Absolute) Performance Error (Md(A)PE) was used to evaluate the difference between bias and inaccuracy of the models. Haemodynamic (mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate) and hypnotic (bispectral index [BIS]) stability was studied. The predictive performance of four alternative propofol PK models was studied.
Results. MdPE and MdAPE did not differ between groups during the pre-adjustment period (control group: 6.3\% and 16\%; intervention group: 5.4\% and 18\%). MdPE differed in the post-adjustment period (12\% vs. 0.3\%), but MdAPE did not (18\% vs. 15\%). No difference in heart rate, MAP or BIS was found. Compared with the other models, the Eleveld propofol PK model (patients) showed the best prediction performance.
Conclusions. When an accurate population-based PK model was used for propofol TCI, Bayesian adaption of the model improved bias but not precision. Clinical trial registration: Dutch Trial Registry NTR4518.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The adverse haemodynamic effects of the intravenous anaesthetic propofol are well known, yet few empirical models have explored the dose-response relationship. Evidence suggests that hypotension during general anaesthesia is associated with postoperative mortality. We developed a mechanism-based model that quantitatively characterises the magnitude of propofol-induced haemodynamic effects during general anaesthesia.
METHODS: Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulse pressure (PP) measurements were available from 36 healthy volunteers who received propofol in a step-up and step-down fashion by target-controlled infusion using the Schnider pharmacokinetic model. A mechanistic pharmacodynamic model was explored based on the Snelder model. To benchmark the performance of this model, we developed empirical models for MAP, HR, and PP.
RESULTS: The mechanistic model consisted of three turnover equations representing total peripheral resistance (TPR), stroke volume (SV), and HR. Propofol-induced changes were implemented by Emax models on the zero-order production rates of the turnover equations for TPR and SV. The estimated 50\% effective concentrations for propofol-induced changes in TPR and SV were 2.96 and 0.34 μg ml-1, respectively. The goodness-of-fit for the mechanism-based model was indistinguishable from the empirical models. Simulations showed that predictions from the mechanism-based model were similar to previously published MAP and HR observations.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a mechanism-based pharmacodynamic model for propofol-induced changes in MAP, TPR, SV, and HR as a potential approach for predicting haemodynamic alterations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Implementing Bayesian methods in a model-based closed-loop system requires the integration of a standard response model with a patient-specific response model. This process makes use of specific modeling weights, called Bayesian variances, which determine how the specific model can deviate from the standard model. In this study we applied simulations to select the Bayesian variances yielding the optimal controller for a Bayesian-based closed-loop system for propofol administration using the Bispectral Index (BIS) as a controlled variable.
METHODS: The relevant Bayesian variances determining the modeling process were identified. Each set of such Bayesian variances represents a potential controller. The set, which will result in optimal control, was estimated using calculations on a simulated population. We selected 625 candidate sets. Similar to our previous closed-loop performance study, we applied a simulation protocol to evaluate controller performance. Our population consisted of 416 virtual patients, generated using population characteristics from previous work. A BIS offset trajectory similar to a surgical case was used.
RESULTS: We were able to develop, describe, and optimize the parameter setting for a patient-individualized model-based closed-loop controller using Bayesian optimization. Selection of the optimal set yields a controller performing with the following median absolute prediction errors at BIS targets 30, 50, and 70: 12.9 +/- 2.87, 7.59 +/- 0.74, and 5.76 +/- 1.03 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe this system can be introduced safely into clinical testing for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia under direct observation of an anesthesiologist.},

	abstract = {Often drug dosage may be chosen rationally by use of plasma concentration (CP) as the "therapeutic" end point. The ability to accurately forecast the CP resulting from a dosage regimen is central to choosing that regimen. Tradionally forecasting has been attempted only by accounting for known influences on pharmacokinetics, such as sex, age, and renal disease. One must also adjust for previously observed CPs. Herein, we discuss and explain an approach to both of these tasks, mainly focusing on the latter. The approach balances observed outcomes against prior expectations taking account of observation CP error. For digoxin, use of 1 measured CP, as opposed to none, improves forecast precision for future CPs by 40\% (decrement in variance of forecast error), and 2 CPs improve it by 67\%. There is also an increase in forecast accuracy (decrement in mean of forecast error) as the number of CPs used increases. After only 2, forecast accuracy and precision are as good as theoretically possible. Moreover, information from CPs is far more valuable for forecasting than that from observable patient features-sex, age, and the like; use of all the latter information does not improve accuracy and precision as much as only 1 CP.},

	doi = {10.1097/00000542-200308000-00014},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To simulate the time course of drug effect, it is sometimes necessary to combine the pharmacodynamic parameters from an integrated pharmacodynamic-pharmacodynamic study (e.g., volumes, clearances, k(e0) [the effect site equilibration rate constant], C(50) [the steady state plasma concentration associated with 50\% maximum effect], and the Hill coefficient) with pharmacokinetic parameters from a different study (e.g., a study examining a different age group or sampling over longer periods of time). Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters form an interlocked vector that describes the relationship between input (dose) and output (effect). Unintended consequences may result if individual elements of this vector (e.g., k(e0)) are combined with pharmacokinetic parameters from a different study. The authors propose an alternative methodology to rationally combine the results of separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, based on t(peak), the time of peak effect after bolus injection.
METHODS: The naive approach to combining separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies is to simply take the k(e0) from the pharmacodynamic study and apply it naively to the pharmacokinetic study of interest. In the t(peak) approach, k(e0) is recalculated using the pharmacokinetics of interest to yield the correct time of peak effect. The authors proposed that the t(peak) method would yield better predictions of the time course of drug effect than the naive approach. They tested this hypothesis in three simulations: thiopental, remifentanil, and propofol.
RESULTS: In each set of simulations, the t(peak) method better approximated the postulated "true" time course of drug effect than the naive method.
CONCLUSIONS: T(peak) is a useful pharmacodynamic parameter and can be used to link separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. This addresses a common difficulty in clinical pharmacology simulation and control problems, where there is usually a wide choice of pharmacokinetic models but only one or two published pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. The results will be immediately applicable to target-controlled anesthetic infusion systems, where linkage of separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters into a single model is inherent in several target-controlled infusion designs.},

AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used.

The Bayesian approach represents the mathematical formulation of the idea that we can update our initial belief about data with the evidence obtained from any kind of acquired data. It provides a theoretical framework and a statistical method to use pre-existing information within the context of new evidence. Several authors have described the Bayesian approach as capable of dealing with uncertainty in medical decision-making. This review describes the Bayes theorem and how it is used in clinical studies in anesthesia and critical care. It starts with a general introduction to the theorem and its related concepts of prior and posterior probabilities. Second, there is an explanation of the basic concepts of the Bayesian statistical inference.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Composite Variability Index (CVI), derived from the electroencephalogram, was developed to assess the antinociception–nociception balance, whereas the Bispectral Index (BIS) was developed to assess the hypnotic state during anesthesia. We studied the relationships between these indices, level of hypnosis (BIS level), and antinociception (predicted remifentanil effect-site concentrations, CeREMI) before and after stimulation. Also, we measured their association with movement in response to a noxious stimulus.
METHODS: We randomized 120 patients to one of 12 groups targeting different hypnotic levels (BIS 70, 50, and 30) and various CeREMI (0, 2, 4, or 6 ng/mL). At pseudo-steady state, baseline values were observed, and a series of stimuli were applied. Changes in BIS, CVI, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) between baseline and response period were analyzed in relation to level of hypnosis, antinociception, and somatic response to the stimuli.
RESULTS: CVI and BIS more accurately correlate with somatic response to an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation-noxious stimulation than HR, MAP, CeREMI, and propofol effect-site concentration (Tukey post hoc tests P {\textless} 0.01). Change in CVI is more adequate to monitor response to stimulation than changes in BIS, HR, or MAP (as described by the Mathews Correlation Coefficient with significance level set at P {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, none of the candidate analgesic state indices was uniquely related to a specific opioid concentration and is extensively influenced by the hypnotic state as measured by BIS.
CONCLUSIONS: CVI appears to correlate with somatic responses to noxious stimuli. However, unstimulated CVI depends more on hypnotic drug effect than on opioid concentration. (Anesth Analg 2014;119:288–301)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Closed-loop control of the hypnotic component of anesthesia has been proposed in an attempt to optimize drug delivery. Here, we introduce a newly developed Bayesian-based, patient-individualized, model-based, adaptive control method for bispectral index (BIS) guided propofol infusion into clinical practice and compare its accuracy and clinical feasibility under direct observation of an anesthesiologist versus BIS guided, effect compartment controlled propofol administration titrated by the anesthesiologist during ambulatory gynecological procedures.
METHODS: Forty ASA patients were randomly allocated to the closed-loop or manual control group. All patients received midazolam 1 mg IV and alfentanil 0.5 mg IV before induction. In the closed-loop control group, propofol was administered using the previously described closed-loop control system to reach and maintain a target BIS of 50. In the manual control group, the propofol effect-site concentration was adapted at the discretion of the anesthesiologist to reach and maintain a BIS as close as possible to 50. Induction characteristics, performance, and robustness during maintenance and recovery times were compared. Hemodynamic and respiratory stability were calculated as clinical feasibility parameters.
RESULTS: The closed-loop control system titrated propofol administration accurately resulting in BIS values close to the set point. The closed-loop control system was able to induce the patients within clinically accepted time limits and with less overshoot than the manual control group. Automated control resulted in beneficial recovery times. Our closed-loop control group showed similar acceptable clinical performance specified by similar hemodynamic, respiratory stability, comparable movement rates, and quality scores than the manual control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The Bayesian-based closed-loop control system for propofol administration using the BIS as a controlled variable performed accurate during anesthesia for ambulatory gynecological procedures. This control system is clinical feasibility and can be further validated in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {A major reason for quantitating the relationship of drug dose to plasma concentration is to design optimal drug administration schemes (i.e., those that can achieve desired target concentrations of a drug). Recently, the authors completed a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the new opioid alfentanil using the computer program NONMEM. This analysis quantified the effects of age, weight, and sex on disposition of alfentanil in 45 patients, and determined the average pharmacokinetic profile of the drug for the group. Using these population pharmacokinetic parameters, one can predict (estimate) the plasma concentration time course of alfentanil for any given dosage scheme. The present study evaluated the accuracy with which one could use these population data to predict plasma concentrations of alfentanil in a different group of surgical patients given iv boluses and a variable-rate infusion of alfentanil for induction and maintenance of anesthesia for abdominal and superficial surgery. A total of 597 plasma concentrations of alfentanil were measured for 19 patients. For each measured concentration, we used the population pharmacokinetic parameters obtained previously with NONMEM to calculate a predicted concentration. Accuracy and precision of the prediction were assessed by the mean bias of the prediction and by the mean absolute prediction error, respectively. The mean bias (+/- SE) (systematic over- or underprediction) was -7.9 +/- 5.2\%. The mean absolute error (+/- SE), a measure of the precision, was 22.3 +/- 2.9\%. Therefore, the authors' previously described population pharmacokinetic parameters for alfentanil appear to be "robust," and can be used to design computerized schemes for administration of alfentanil for general surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraoperation hypotension (IOH) is commonly observed in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia, and even a brief episode of IOH can lead to unfavorable outcomes. To reduce the risk, blood pressure is closely measured during general anesthesia, and norepinephrine (NE) is frequently administered if hypotension is detected. Despite its routine application, information on the dose-exposure-response relationship of NE remains limited. Additionally, quantification of the influence of general anesthesia on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NE is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to describe NE PK in healthy volunteers and the influence of general anesthesia on its PK.
METHODS: A single-center, cross-over study was conducted in healthy volunteers. The volunteers received a step-up NE dosing scheme (0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16 and 0.20 mcg-1/kg-1/min-1) first in the awake state and then under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was administered using a propofol/remifentanil Eleveld target-controlled infusion. During general anesthesia, a 30-second electrical stimulus was given as surrogate for surgical incision to the volunteers at each dosage step. Blood samples were drawn before the initial dosing and after each dosing step, and plasma NE, propofol and remifentanil concentrations were subsequently determined. A population PK model was developed using non-linear mixed effects modelling. Simulations were conducted to predict the plasma NE concentration in patients at different measured propofol concentrations.
RESULTS: A total of 1219 samples were analyzed from 36 volunteers. A two-compartment model with a first-order elimination best described the data. Weight, age, and session effect (awake vs general anesthesia) were identified as relevant covariates on the clearance (CL) of NE. A 10\% decrease in NE CL was observed after general anesthesia induction. This difference between sessions is better explained by the measured concentration of propofol, rather than the anticipated impact of cardiac output. The estimated post-stimulation NE concentration is 0.66 nmol/L-1 (95\% CI 0.06-1.20 nmol/L-1) lower than the pre-stimulation NE concentration. Model simulation indicates that patients at a higher measured propofol concentration (e.g., 6 mcg/mL-1) exhibited higher NE concentrations (95\% PI 18.10-43.89 nmol/L-1) than patients at a lower measured propofol concentration (e.g., 3 mcg/mL-1) (95\% PI 16.81-38.91 nmol L-1).
CONCLUSION: The NE PK is well described with a two-compartment model with a first-order elimination. NE CL exhibiting a 10\% decrease under general anesthesia, with this difference being attributed to the measured concentration of propofol. The impact of stimulation on NE PK under general anesthesia is very limited.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous pharmacokinetic models have been published aiming at more accurate and safer dosing of dexmedetomidine. The vast majority of the developed models underpredict the measured plasma concentrations with respect to the target concentration, especially at plasma concentrations higher than those used in the original studies. The aim of this article was to develop a dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic model in healthy adults emphasizing linear versus nonlinear kinetics.
METHODS: The data of two previously published clinical trials with stepwise increasing dexmedetomidine target-controlled infusion were pooled to build a pharmacokinetic model using the NONMEM software package (ICON Development Solutions, USA). Data from 48 healthy subjects, included in a stratified manner, were utilized to build the model.
RESULTS: A three-compartment mamillary model with nonlinear elimination from the central compartment was superior to a model assuming linear pharmacokinetics. Covariates included in the final model were age, sex, and total body weight. Cardiac output did not explain between-subject or within-subject variability in dexmedetomidine clearance. The results of a simulation study based on the final model showed that at concentrations up to 2 ng · ml-1, the predicted dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations were similar between the currently available Hannivoort model assuming linear pharmacokinetics and the nonlinear model developed in this study. At higher simulated plasma concentrations, exposure increased nonlinearly with target concentration due to the decreasing dexmedetomidine clearance with increasing plasma concentrations. Simulations also show that currently approved dosing regimens in the intensive care unit may potentially lead to higher-than-expected dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a nonlinear three-compartment pharmacokinetic model that accurately described dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations. Dexmedetomidine may be safely administered up to target-controlled infusion targets under 2 ng · ml-1 using the Hannivoort model, which assumed linear pharmacokinetics. Consideration should be taken during long-term administration and during an initial loading dose when following the dosing strategies of the current guidelines.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Propofol and remifentanil are frequently combined for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. Both propofol and remifentanil cause vasodilation and potentially reduce arterial BP. We aimed to develop a mechanism-based model that characterises the haemodynamic interactions between remifentanil and propofol.
METHODS: Data from two clinical trials in healthy volunteers were analysed using remifentanil-alone, propofol-alone, and combination groups. We evaluated remifentanil effects on haemodynamics using a previously developed mechanism-based haemodynamic model of propofol. The interaction between propofol and remifentanil was explored using the principles of the general pharmacodynamic interaction (GPDI) model.
RESULTS: Remifentanil alone increased the dissipation rate of total peripheral resistance by 50\% at 3.0 ng ml-1. Additionally, the dissipation rates of HR and stroke volume were attenuated by 4.8\% and 4.9\% per 1 ng ml-1 increase in remifentanil concentration, respectively. The maximal effect of propofol alone in decreasing the production rate of total peripheral resistance was 78\%, which decreased to 32\% when combined with remifentanil 4 ng ml-1. The effects of remifentanil on HR and stroke volume were attenuated by propofol with maximum decreases of 11.9\% and 21.2\%, respectively. Goodness-of-fit plots and prediction-corrected visual predictive check plots showed good predictive performance of the models.
CONCLUSIONS: The structure of the previous mechanism-based haemodynamic model for propofol was able to describe the effects of remifentanil alone on haemodynamic variables. The GPDI model provided a good framework for characterising the pharmacodynamic interaction between remifentanil and propofol on haemodynamic properties.

	abstract = {This single blinded randomized controlled trial aims to assess whether the application of a Bayesian-adjusted CePROP (effect-site of propofol) advisory tool leads towards a more stringent control of the cerebral drug effect during anaesthesia, using qCON as control variable. 100 patients scheduled for elective surgery were included and randomized into a control or intervention group (1:1 ratio). In the intervention group the advisory screen was made available to the clinician, whereas it was blinded in the control group. The settings of the target-controlled infusion pumps could be adjusted at any time by the clinician. Cerebral drug effect was quantified using processed EEG (CONOX monitor, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany). The time of qCON between the desired range (35-55) during anaesthesia maintenance was defined as our primary end point. Induction parameters and recovery times were considered secondary end points and coefficient of variance of qCON and CePROP was calculated in order to survey the extent of control towards the mean of the population. The desired range of qCON between 35 and 55 was maintained in 84\% vs. 90\% (p = 0.15) of the case time in the control versus intervention group, respectively. Secondary endpoints showed similar results in both groups. The coefficient of variation for CePROP was higher in the intervention group. The application of the Bayesian-based CePROP advisory system in this trial did not result in a different time of qCON between 35 and 55 (84 [21] vs. 90 [18] percent of the case time). Significant differences between groups were hard to establish, most likely due to a very high performance level in the control group. More extensive control efforts were found in the intervention group. We believe that this advisory tool could be a useful educational tool for novices to titrate propofol effect-site concentrations.},

	abstract = {Post-induction hypotension (MAP {\textless} 65 mmHg) occurs frequently and is usually caused by the cardiovascular adverse effects of the anaesthetic induction drugs used. We hypothesize that a clinically significant difference in the incidence and severity of hypotension will be found when different doses of propofol and remifentanil are used for induction of anaesthesia.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial wherein four groups (A-D) of patients received one out of four different combinations of propofol and remifentanil, titrated to a predicted equipotency in probability of tolerance to laryngoscopy (PTOL) according to the Bouillon interaction model. In group A, a high dose of propofol and a low dose of remifentanil was administered, and across the groups this ratio was gradually changed until it was reversed in group D. Mean and systolic arterial blood pressure (MAP, SAP) were compared at four time points (Tbaseline, Tpost-bolus, T3min, Tnadir) within and between groups Heart rate, bispectral index (BIS) and the incidence of hypotension were compared.
RESULTS: Data from 76 patients was used. At Tpost-bolus a statistically significant lower MAP and SAP was found in group A versus D (p = 0.011 and p = 0.002). A significant higher heart rate was found at T3min and Tnadir between groups A and B when compared to groups C and D (p = {\textless} 0.001 and p = 0.002). A significant difference in BIS value was found over all groups at T3min and Tnadir (both p {\textless} 0.001). All other outcomes did not differ significantly between groups.
CONCLUSION: Induction of anaesthesia with different predicted equipotent combinations of propofol and remifentanil did result in statistically different but clinically irrelevant differences in haemodynamic endpoints during induction of anaesthesia. Our study could not identify preferable drug combinations that decrease the risk for hypotension after induction, although they all yield a similar predicted PTOL.},

Therefore, the aim of this study was to study the perioperative dynamics of plasma mtDNA during living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) and its potential as a marker of graft outcome. Fifty-six donor-recipient couples from the Volatile Anesthetic Protection of Renal Transplants-1 (VAPOR-1) trial were included. Systemic venous, systemic arterial, and renal venous samples were taken at multiple timepoints during and after LDKT. Levels of mtDNA genes changed over time and between vascular compartments. Several donor, recipient, and transplantation-related variables significantly explained the course of mtDNA genes over time. mtDNA genes predicted 1-month and 24-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and acute rejection episodes in the two-year follow-up period. To conclude, mtDNA is released in plasma during the process of LDKT, either from the kidney or from the whole body in response to transplantation. While circulating mtDNA levels positively and negatively predict post-transplantation outcomes, the exact mechanisms and difference between mtDNA genes are not yet understood and need further exploration.},

	abstract = {Target controlled infusion (TCI) is a clinically-available and widely-used computer-controlled method of drug administration, adjusting the drug titration towards user selected plasma- or effect-site concentrations, calculated according to pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models. Although this technology is clinically available for several anaesthetic drugs, the contemporary commercialised PKPD models suffer from multiple limitations. First, PKPD models for anaesthetic drugs are developed using deliberately selected patient populations, often excluding the more challenging populations, such as children, obese or elderly patients, of whom the body composition or elimination mechanisms may be structurally different compared to the lean adult patient population. Separate PKPD models have been developed for some of these subcategories, but the availability of multiple PKPD models for a single drug increases the risk for invalid model selection by the user. Second, some models are restricted to the prediction of plasma-concentration without enabling effect-site controlled TCI or they identify the effect-site equilibration rate constant using methods other than PKPD modelling. Advances in computing and the emergence of globally collected databases has allowed the development of new "general purpose" PKPD models. These take on the challenging task of identifying the relationships between patient covariates (age, weight, sex, etc) and the volumes and clearances of multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic models applicable across broad populations from neonates to the elderly, from the underweight to the obese. These models address the issues of allometric scaling of body weight and size, body composition, sex differences, changes with advanced age, and for young children, changes with maturation and growth. General purpose models for propofol, remifentanil and dexmedetomidine have appeared and these greatly reduce the risk of invalid model selection. In this narrative review, we discuss the development, characteristics and validation of several described general purpose PKPD models for anaesthetic drugs.},

It provides a theoretical framework and a statistical method to use pre-existing information within the context of new evidence. Several authors have described the Bayesian approach as capable of dealing with uncertainty in medical decision-making. This review describes the Bayes theorem and how it is used in clinical studies in anesthesia and critical care. It starts with a general introduction to the theorem and its related concepts of prior and posterior probabilities. Second, there is an explanation of the basic concepts of the Bayesian statistical inference.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly patients comprise an increasing proportion of patients undergoing surgery, and they require special attention due to age-related physiological changes. Propofol is the traditional agent for anaesthesia, and recently, remimazolam, a novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, has emerged as an alternative to propofol in general anaesthesia.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to compare remimazolam vs . propofol for general anaesthesia in elderly patients regarding hypotension, induction characteristics, haemodynamics and recovery outcomes.
DESIGN: Meta-analysis with sensitivity and trial sequential analyses (TSA) to assess inconsistencies. Risk ratios and mean differences with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were computed using a random effects model. Subgroups and meta-regression according to anaesthesia methods were also performed.
DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to January 1, 2024.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Patients at least 60 years old, comparing remimazolam vs . propofol for general anaesthesia.
RESULTS: Eleven RCTs (947 patients) were included. Compared with propofol, remimazolam was associated with lower postinduction and intra-operative hypotension (RR 0.41, 95\% CI 0.27 to 0.62, P  {\textless} 0.001) and incidence of bradycardia (risk ratio 0.58, 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.98, P  = 0.04), with a higher heart rate ( P  = 0.01). The incidence of injection pain was lower ( P  {\textless} 0.001), but remimazolam was associated with a longer time to loss of consciousness ( P  {\textless} 0.001) and a higher bispectral index at loss of consciousness ( P  = 0.04). No differences were found for mean arterial pressure, emergence time, extubation time and incidence of emergence agitation. The TSA was consistent and achieved the required information size for hypotension.
CONCLUSIONS: Remimazolam significantly reduced the risk of hypotension, bradycardia and injection pain, despite an increase in the time to loss of consciousness. Remimazolam appears to be an effective and well tolerated alternative to propofol in elderly patients undergoing general anaesthesia.},

A total of 365 patients (ASA physical status 3 or 4) scheduled for elective surgery were assigned randomly to receive total intravenous anaesthesia with remimazolam (n = 270) or propofol (n = 95). Primary outcome was anaesthetic effect, quantified as the percentage of time with Narcotrend® Index values ≤ 60, during surgery (skin incision to last skin suture), with a non-inferiority margin of -10\%. Secondary outcome was the incidence of postinduction hypotensive events. Mean (SD) percentage of time with Narcotrend Index values ≤ 60 during surgery across all patients receiving remimazolam (93\% (20.7)) was non-inferior to propofol (99\% (4.2)), mean difference (97.5\%CI) -6.28\% (-8.89-infinite); p = 0.003.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extent of lymphadenectomy in colon cancer (CC) is a matter of debate. One argument of extensive surgery is that it may prevent lymph node recurrence (LNR). However, the incidence of LNR after surgery for CC is unknown. Here, we performed a systematic review of the incidence of LNR after either standard (D2) surgery or extensive resection (complete mesocolic excision, CME, D3).
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CENTRAL were searched for studies reporting on patients with primary stage I-III CC who developed locoregional or distant LNR. Methodological quality was scored using the QualSyst tool. The difference in overall and lymph node (LN) recurrence rate between CME/D3 and standard/D2 resection was statistically evaluated using non-parametric tests. Registered with PROPERO as CRD42020203288.
RESULTS: From an initial 12.744 records, 24 studies were included, representing 13.521 CC patients. A majority of patients had right CC (64\%), stage III disease (51\%), and received adjuvant chemotherapy (57\%). The mean number of examined nodes ranged from 14 to 30. The median overall recurrence rate was 14\% in the CME/D3 group, and 19\% in the standard/D2 group (P = 0.638). The median proportion of patients with any LNR was 1.7\% in the CME/D3 group, and 1.2\% in the standard/D2 group (P = 0.677). The median incidence of locoregional, potentially preventable LNR was 0\% in the CME/D3 group and 0.4\% in the standard/D2 group (P = 0.274).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of locoregional, potentially preventable LNR after surgery for CC is low (\&lt;1\%), and is not affected by the extent of lymphadenectomy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are various pharmacokinetic-dynamic models available, which describe the time course of drug concentration and effect and which can be incorporated into target-controlled infusion (TCI) systems. For anesthesia and sedation, most of these models are derived from narrow patient populations, which restricts applicability for the overall population, including (small) children, elderly, and obese patients. This forces clinicians to select specific models for specific populations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, general purpose models have been developed for propofol and remifentanil using data from multiple studies and broad, diverse patient groups. General-purpose models might reduce the risks associated with extrapolation, incorrect usage, and unfamiliarity with a specific TCI-model, as they offer less restrictive boundaries (i.e., the patient "doesn't fit in the selected model") compared with the earlier, simpler models. Extrapolation of a model can lead to delayed recovery or inadequate anesthesia. If multiple models for the same drug are implemented in the pump, it is possible to select the wrong model for that specific case; this can be overcome with one general purpose model implemented in the pump.
SUMMARY: This article examines the usability of these general-purpose models in relation to the more traditional models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Remimazolam exhibits sedative properties by binding to γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Remimazolam is administered as a bolus dose or continuous infusion, but has not been studied using target-controlled infusion (TCI). The study quantified the relationship between the remimazolam concentration, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAAS) score, and bispectral index (BIS) using TCI.
METHODS: The authors performed a three-period, crossover, dose-ranging clinical trial in 24 healthy volunteers using age and sex stratification. Data collected in the first period, where remimazolam was administered alone using a step-up and step-down TCI protocol, were used for this analysis. Remimazolam concentrations, MOAAS scores, and BIS values were collected at each step at steady state. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methodology.
RESULTS: The relationship between remimazolam, BIS, and MOAAS differed between step-up and step-down infusions at similar remimazolam target concentrations. Tolerance, driven by remimazolam or CNS7054, significantly improved overall model fit (P {\textless} 0.01) for both BIS and MOAAS models. After 30 min of repeated bolus dosing, mimicking the regimen in the label for procedural sedation, the BIS and probability of MOAAS 2/3 were predicted to be 54 (95\% prediction interval, 44 to 67) and 2\% (95\% prediction interval, 0 to 32\%) versus 58 (95\% prediction interval, 48 to 70) and 8\% (95\% prediction interval, 0 to 36\%) in a model without and with tolerance, respectively. After 60 min of continuous infusion, mimicking the regimen in the label for general anesthesia, the BIS and probability of MOAAS 0 were predicted to be 40 (95\% prediction interval, 33 to 50) and 87\% (95\% prediction interval, 18 to 100\%) versus 50 (95\% prediction interval, 41 to 60) and 59\% (95\% prediction interval, 6 to 99\%) in a model without and with tolerance, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was shown that remimazolam-induced sedation is prone to tolerance development, which is potentially mediated by the CNS7054 concentration. The clinical consequences are, however, limited in situations where remimazolam is titrated to effect.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: During general anesthesia, arterial hypotension is frequent and may be an important contributor to perioperative morbidity. We assessed the effect of a 5 μg bolus of Norepinephrine (NA) when compared with 50 μg bolus of Phenylephrine (PE) administered to treat hypotension during maintenance anesthesia, on MAP, derived cardiac output and arterial stiffness parameters.
METHODS: Patients scheduled for a neurosurgical procedure under general anesthesia were prospectively included. Monitoring included invasive blood pressure, esophageal Doppler, and arterial tonometer used to estimate central aortic pressure with arterial stiffness parameters, such as augmentation index (Aix). After initial resuscitation, hypotensive episodes were corrected by a bolus administration of NA or PE in a peripheral venous line.
RESULTS: There were 269 bolus administrations of vasopressors (149 NA, 120 PE) in 47 patients with no adverse effects detected. A decrease in stroke volume (SV) was observed with PE compared with NA (-18 ± 9\% vs. -14 ± 7\%, P {\textless} 0.001). This decrease was associated with an increase in Aix, which was greater for PE than for NA (+10 ± 8\% vs. +6 ± 6\%, P {\textless} 0.0001), and a decrease in total arterial compliance greater for PE compared to NA (Ctot = SV/Central Pulse Pressure) (-35 ± 9\% vs. -29 ± 10\%, P {\textless} 0.001).
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that 5 μg of NA administered as a bolus in a peripheral venous line could treat general anesthesia-induced arterial hypotension with a smaller decrease in SV and arterial compliance when compared to PE.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models are used in target-controlled-infusion (TCI) systems to determine the optimal drug administration to achieve a desired target concentration in a central or effect-site compartment. Our aim was to develop a PK-PD model for propofol that can predict the bispectral index (BIS) for a broad population, suitable for TCI applications.
METHODS: Propofol PK data were obtained from 30 previously published studies, five of which also contained BIS observations. A PK-PD model was developed using NONMEM. Weight, age, post-menstrual age (PMA), height, sex, BMI, and presence/absence of concomitant anaesthetic drugs were explored as covariates. The predictive performance was measured across young children, children, adults, elderly, and high-BMI individuals, and in simulated TCI applications.
RESULTS: Overall, 15 433 propofol concentration and 28 639 BIS observations from 1033 individuals (672 males and 361 females) were analysed. The age range was from 27 weeks PMA to 88 yr, and the weight range was 0.68-160 kg. The final model uses age, PMA, weight, height, sex, and presence/absence of concomitant anaesthetic drugs as covariates. A 35-yr-old, 170 cm, 70 kg male (without concomitant anaesthetic drugs) has a V1, V2, V3, CL, Q2, Q3, and ke0 of 6.28, 25.5, 273 litres, 1.79, 1.75, 1.11 litres min-1, and 0.146 min-1, respectively. The propofol TCI administration using the model matches well with recommendations for all age groups considered for both anaesthesia and sedation.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a PK-PD model to predict the propofol concentrations and BIS for broad, diverse population. This should be useful for TCI in anaesthesia and sedation.},

	abstract = {Aims
              Intraoperative hypotension is a risk factor for kidney, heart and cognitive postoperative complications. Literature suggests that the use of low‐dose peripheral norepinephrine (NOR) reduces organ dysfunction, yet its administration remains unstandardized. In this work we develop a pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) model of NOR and its effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP).
            
            
              Methods
              From June 2018 to December 2021, we included patients scheduled for elective neurosurgery and requiring vasopressors for intraoperative hypotension management at Lariboisière Hospital, Paris. Low doses of NOR were administered peripherally, and successive arterial blood samples were collected to track its plasmatic concentration. We used a compartmental modelling approach for NOR PK. We developed and compared 2 models for NOR PD on MAP. Model comparison was done using Bayes information criteria. The resulting PK/PD model parameters were fitted over the entire population and linked to age, weight, height and sex.
            
            
              Results
              We included 29 patients (age 52 [46–64] years, 69\% female). NOR median time to peak effect on MAP was 74 [53–94] s. After bolus administration, MAP increased by 24\% (15–31\%). A 2‐comparment model with depot best captured NOR PK. NOR PD effect on MAP was well represented by both Emax and Windkessel models, with better results for the former. We found that age, height and weight as well as history of smoking and hypertension were correlated with model parameters.
            
            
              Conclusion
              We have developed a PK/PD model to accurately track norepinephrine plasma concentration and its effect on MAP over time, which could serve for target‐controlled infusion.},

In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic ̂R of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious ﬂaws. Traditional ̂R will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that ﬁxes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efﬁciency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

@article{zhang_pathnder_nodate,
	title = {Pathﬁnder: {Parallel} quasi-{Newton} variational inference},
	abstract = {We propose Pathﬁnder, a variational method for approximately sampling from differentiable probability densities. Starting from a random initialization, Pathﬁnder locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathﬁnder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the target distribution. We evaluate Pathﬁnder on a wide range of posterior distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC runs, Pathﬁnder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors. Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathﬁnder improves the diversity of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL divergence estimates are embarrassingly parallelizable in the core Pathﬁnder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the resampling version, further increasing Pathﬁnder’s speed advantage with multiple cores.},

	abstract = {Non-linear mixed effects models typically deal with stochasticity in observed processes but models accounting for only observed processes may not be the most appropriate for all data. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) characterize the relationship between observed and hidden variables where the hidden variables can represent an underlying and unmeasurable disease status for example. Adding stochasticity to HMMs results in mixed HMMs (MHMMs) which potentially allow for the characterization of variability in unobservable processes. Further, HMMs can be extended to include more than one observation source and are then multivariate HMMs. In this work MHMMs were developed and applied in a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease example. The two hidden states included in the model were remission and exacerbation and two observation sources were considered, patient reported outcomes (PROs) and forced expiratory volume (FEV1). Estimation properties in the software NONMEM of model parameters were investigated with and without random and covariate effect parameters. The inﬂuence of including random and covariate effects of varying magnitudes on the parameters in the model was quantiﬁed and a power analysis was performed to compare the power of a single bivariate MHMM with two separate univariate MHMMs. A bivariate MHMM was developed for simulating and analysing hypothetical COPD data consisting of PRO and FEV1 measurements collected every week for 60 weeks. Parameter precision was high for all parameters with the exception of the variance of the transition rate dictating the transition from remission to exacerbation (relative root mean squared error [RRMSE] [ 150\%). Parameter precision was better with higher magnitudes of the transition probability parameters. A drug effect was included on the transition rate probability and the precision of the drug effect parameter improved with increasing magnitude of the parameter. The power to detect the drug effect was improved by utilizing a bivariate MHMM model over the univariate MHMM models where the number of subject required for 80\% power was 25 with the bivariate MHMM model versus 63 in the univariate MHMM FEV1 model and [ 100 in the univariate MHMM PRO model. The results advocates for the use of bivariate MHMM models when implementation is possible.},
