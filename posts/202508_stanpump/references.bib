  abstract = {nlmixr is a free and open-source R package for fitting nonlinear pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), joint PK-PD, and quantitative systems pharmacology mixed-effects models. Currently, nlmixr is capable of fitting both traditional compartmental PK models as well as more complex models implemented using ordinary differential equations. We believe that, over time, it will become a capable, credible alternative to commercial software tools, such as NONMEM, Monolix, and Phoenix NLME.},

Computer-controlled infusion pumps have been developed which dose intravenous drugs based on models of drug disposition. These pumps can maintain steady plasma drug concentrations and facilitate controlled increases and decreases in drug concentration, enhancing titration of intravenous drugs. Several investigators have proposed analytical solutions to the biexponential and triexponential disposition functions for use in computer-controlled infusion pumps. Because of the complexity of these analytical solutions, other investigators have used numerical techniques to approximate the analytical solution. We have derived an extremely simple analytical solution to polyexponential disposition functions. This solution simplifies both the prediction of the plasma drug concentration by a computer-controlled infusion pump and the stepwise calculation of the infusion rate required to maintain constant plasma drug concentrations.},

	abstract = {The combination of propofol and alfentanil was administered to 20 patients for total intravenous anaesthesia during general surgery. The infusion rates for both drugs were controlled by microprocessors in order to institute constant blood levels adapted to the patients' varying needs. The mean blood level of propofol required for adequate hypnosis during anaesthesia was 2.42 micrograms/ml (SD 0.43). Awakening occurred 7.9 minutes (SD 3.4) after the end of the infusion, at a propofol blood level of 1.59 micrograms/ml (SD 0.34). The plasma level of alfentanil was 285 ng/ml (SD 72) during major noxious stimulation and 148 ng/ml (SD 56) during minor stimulation. The computer-assisted infusions showed a measured/predicted ratio of 1.01 (SD 0.28) for alfentanil and 0.88 (SD 0.22) for propofol. This indicates that the administration device used in this study is reasonably reliable. The technique of total intravenous anaesthesia was characterised by a smooth induction without significant haemodynamic alterations, by good control during anaesthesia and by a very fast recovery without major side effects.},

	abstract = {A major reason for quantitating the relationship of drug dose to plasma concentration is to design optimal drug administration schemes (i.e., those that can achieve desired target concentrations of a drug). Recently, the authors completed a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the new opioid alfentanil using the computer program NONMEM. This analysis quantified the effects of age, weight, and sex on disposition of alfentanil in 45 patients, and determined the average pharmacokinetic profile of the drug for the group. Using these population pharmacokinetic parameters, one can predict (estimate) the plasma concentration time course of alfentanil for any given dosage scheme. The present study evaluated the accuracy with which one could use these population data to predict plasma concentrations of alfentanil in a different group of surgical patients given iv boluses and a variable-rate infusion of alfentanil for induction and maintenance of anesthesia for abdominal and superficial surgery. A total of 597 plasma concentrations of alfentanil were measured for 19 patients. For each measured concentration, we used the population pharmacokinetic parameters obtained previously with NONMEM to calculate a predicted concentration. Accuracy and precision of the prediction were assessed by the mean bias of the prediction and by the mean absolute prediction error, respectively. The mean bias (+/- SE) (systematic over- or underprediction) was -7.9 +/- 5.2\%. The mean absolute error (+/- SE), a measure of the precision, was 22.3 +/- 2.9\%. Therefore, the authors' previously described population pharmacokinetic parameters for alfentanil appear to be "robust," and can be used to design computerized schemes for administration of alfentanil for general surgery.},

Length of sampling and assay sensitivity are key factors involved in accurately estimating the volumes of distribution, clearances, and elimination phase. The unit disposition function of increasing doses of sufentanil were investigated and the influence of dose administered on the linearity of pharmacokinetics was assessed.},
