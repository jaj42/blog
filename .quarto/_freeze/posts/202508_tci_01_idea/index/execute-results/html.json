There are also a lot of ressources available on how to develop PKPD models and there is open source software available to develop and fit these models @nlmixr.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the constants from the Gepts model for Sufentanil.\n\n::: {#24128dfe .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Linearity of Pharmacokinetics and Model Estimation of Sufentanil by Gepts et al.\n# DOI: 10.1097/00000542-199512000-00010\n\nVc = 14.3    # L\nk10 = 0.0645 # min⁻¹\nk12 = 0.1086 # min⁻¹\nk13 = 0.0229 # min⁻¹\nk21 = 0.0245 # min⁻¹\nk31 = 0.0013 # min⁻¹\nke0 = 0.112  # min⁻¹\n```\n:::\n\n\nDifferential equations for the 3-compartment model PK system\n\n$\\frac{dA_1}{dt} = A_2 k_{21} + A_3 k_{31} - A_1(k_{10} + k_{12} + k_{13}) + \\text{Infusion}$\n\n$\\frac{dA_2}{dt} = A_1 k_{12} - A_2 k_{21}$\n\n$\\frac{dA_3}{dt} = A_1 k_{13} - A_3 k_{31}$\n\n$\\frac{dC_e}{dt} = k_{e0}\\left(\\frac{A_1}{V_c} - C_e\\right)$\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n",
